# Aritifical Intelligence
This repository stores the lab code for the CS303 Artificial Intelligence course, covering the implementation of core algorithms in the field of AI.

Algorithms includes:
- Search Algorithms: Depth-First Search (DFS), Breadth-First Search (BFS), Uniform-Cost Search (UCS), Greedy Best-First Search (GBFS), A* Search, etc.
- Adversarial & Constrained Search Algorithms: Min-Max Algorithm, Backtracking Search (BTS), etc.
- Local Search Algorithms: Genetic Algorithms, Hill Climbing, Simulated Annealing, etc.
- Machine Learning Algorithms: Regression, Support Vector Machine (SVM), Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP), Decision Tree, Naive Bayes, etc.
